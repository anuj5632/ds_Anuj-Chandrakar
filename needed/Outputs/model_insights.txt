Observations:
- The model performs reasonably well in identifying profitable trades.
- Class weighting helps mitigate the imbalance between profitable and unprofitable trades.
- Features like start_position, side_buy, and execution_price have the strongest influence on predicting trade profitability.
- Further improvements can be made by including market indicators like Fear & Greed Index, technical indicators, or rolling statistics.

Recommendations:
- Use this model to flag potentially profitable trades, but combine with domain knowledge.
- Consider ensemble approaches or hyperparameter tuning to improve F1-score for profitable trades.
